# 🌾 Crop Yield Predictor

A machine learning-based system to predict **crop yield (hg/ha)** using historical agricultural data including crop type, geographical area, rainfall, pesticide usage, and temperature. This tool aims to support **farmers and agricultural planners** by providing an estimate of crop production, helping them make informed decisions.
